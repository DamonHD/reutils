ALL SIGNIFICANT RELEASES AND BRANCHES


This document is used to record all significant releases and branches
in the code tree.

Follow agreed procedures before creating (or deleting) branches
or release/freeze points.


IMMEDIATE TODO
==============

Cache the raw properties after first loading and parsing for efficiency.

Add optional 'green window' (eg 1am to 5am) outwith which even pure predictive output is not allowed to go green in absence of live data.

Allow for WIND (and other fuel) fudge factor (for embedded generation invisible to Elexon) with optional comment/explanation.

For long-term data analysis show fraction of hear hour/day/month in bottom 1/3, 1/4 intensity, no PS, green/supergreen, etc.

Store a week's worth of data for better predictions on most days except holidays such as Xmas and have special treatment for them.

Change sendTweet to send depending on status colour change only, eg not text change to avoid spurious messages when switching between live and predictive modes.
