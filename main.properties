<p>This free service is in <strong>BETA</strong> and may be unavailable or withdrawn at any time and is provided \"as-is\" with no warranties of any kind.</p>\r\n\
<p>This page shows the current "<strong>carbon intensity</strong>" of the GB National Grid \
(ie the England/Scotland/Wales portions of the UK electricity grid) \
as a simple traffic-light indicator.\r\n\
Carbon intensity is a measure of how much greenhouse-house gas (especially CO2 or carbon dioxide)\r\n\
is emitted to generate a fixed amount of electricity.</p>\r\n\
<p>Anything other than a <strong style="color:green">GREEN</strong> light \
suggests that you should consider deferring heavy loads (eg starting a dishwasher or washing-machine at home) \
because the carbon intensity is relatively high, or because of other factors. \
Avoiding running major appliances such as washing/heating/cooking during <strong style="color:red">RED</strong> times will save CO2 emissions.</p>\r\n\
<p><strong>You should still conserve first</strong>: \
don't run things that don't need to be run at all, \
don't leave things on that can be turned off at the wall, \
run full loads in your washing machine and dishwasher, etc, etc, \
before worrying about carbon intensity.</p> \
<p><strong>Planning ahead</strong>: note that in the UK/GB peak demand for electricity will usually be <strong>4pm to 9pm</strong> (and a lesser peak around 9am/10am), \
and peak carbon intensity is often around peak demand, so try to avoid big loads then; \
<strong>if possible run loads such as your dishwasher and washing machine overnight</strong>, \
eg on a delay timer or just as you go to bed.</p>\r\n\
<p>(Shifting loads to the night when energy is otherwise going into grid-scale storage such as pumped hydro, avoids pulling it out when you would otherwise run/dispatch the load, and thus saves round-trip losses of ~25%.)</p>\r\n

# HTML outlining the methodology.
methodology.HTML=\
<p>This estimates the the carbon intensity of generation connected to \
the National Grid GB (Great Britain) high-voltage transmission system, \
ignoring (pumped) storage and exports but including imports via interconnectors. \
This excludes 'embedded' generation, eg connected directly to the distribution system, \
such as small diesels, domestic microgeneration and a significant chunk of wind power, \
all of which also benefits from reduced transmission/distribution losses, \
so actual intensity may be somewhat different to (and probably lower than) that reported. \
However the emissions cost of each marginal/conserved kWh is probably accurately reflected.</p>
