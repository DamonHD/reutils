IMMEDIATE TODO
==============

John Stott RFE: the page could be improved for the benefit of those knowing little about electricity generation by defining the acronyms. e.g. INTIRL , NPSHYD etc . Even though I have worked in the electricity and energy field, I am not familiar with all the abbreviations used.
